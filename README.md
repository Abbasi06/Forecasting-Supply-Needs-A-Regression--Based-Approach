# Forecasting-Supply-Needs-A-Regression--Based-Approach
This Project optimizes supply chain performance of an FMCG company in the instant noodles market, addressing supply-demand mismatches in warehouses. It compares  linear regression and multiple linear regression models with and without interaction and quadratic terms to predict the optimal product shipment weights.

## Project Highlights
- Objective: Minimize inventory costs while meeting regional demand.
- Dataset: 25,000 rows and 24 variables, cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.
- Key Techniques:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering (Quadratic & Interaction Terms)
  - Model Validation (K-Fold Cross-Validation)
  - Residual and Multicollinearity Analysis
  - Model Performance: Adjusted RÂ² of 89.76%, indicating strong predictive capability

## Deliverables
- Code: R-Script for EDA, Data Pre-processing, model building, Hypothesis testing, Model validation, Outlier analysis, Residual analysis & multicollinearity analysis
- Report: Detailed analysis and findings.
- Presentation: Visual summary of the project 

## Key Insights
- Storage issues and transportation challenges significantly impact product shipment weight
